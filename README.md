# Watch-Shop
This is my exam project that I built during the ReactJS Course in SoftUni.
It's a watch store, where you can buy watches! There are two roles 'Admin' and 'User'. Normal
Users can buy watches, add them to cart, add them to favourite, view their orders. Admins can also 
do these things but they can also add watch, view all orders and change their status, view all users
and give or remove them admin rights. They can also edit and remove watches.
